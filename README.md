# MSDS-631
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on learning complex, hierarchical
feature representations from raw data. Over the past decade, deep learning has been remarkably
successful at solving a massive set of problems on data types including images and sequential data.
This success drove the extension of deep learning to other discrete domains such as sets, point
clouds , graphs, and 3D shapes.


This course introduces the student to a range of topics and concepts in deep learning including
the foundation neural networks, most common neural network architectures such as MLP, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks to name a few. We will also go over advanced topics such as generative models, geometric deep learning and graph neural networks.
The course covers a practical aspects of deep learning and students get to learn how to use pytroch
for creation/training/ineference of various networks. Intuition, mathematical notions as well as the
practical aspects are all emphasized throughout the course and by the end of the course the student
should have a solid theoerical and practical foundation of deep learning
